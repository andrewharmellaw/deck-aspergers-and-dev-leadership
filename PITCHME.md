## Me: Before and After 40

---

For 40 years I didnt know I was aspergers

I had spent 40 years knowing deep down that my sensory, emotional and intellectual experiences were a bit different from everyone elses.
But I'd dismissed these as artefacts, as blips, and worked really hard to learn from everyone else

I'd learned to "pass".

But then things got to breaking point.  Situations arose where it became clear that things were different, and so I got diagnosed.

This wasn;t a bad thing - it was the complete opposite.  But I had to unlearn.  And what is more I had to learn things I knew nothing about - i learned things which upset me, and I learned things which made me happy.  I learned about history and i learned about people's lved experience. 

And I had to introspect (because ASD is _very_ different in people)

It transformed me.

---

There's another part to the story

Based on what I _thought_ I knew about people with Aspergers (prior to doing my reading) - the "common knowledge" - I should be a terrible team lead and dev team manager.

But I was good at it.

And not only was I good at it, I *loved* it.  

Hmmm

---

(Bit in between the first part of the story and the relate to everyone...)

What's the proof? I shouldn't be good at this (these things shouldn't work) 

But I am, (and they do)! 

---

What I want to ask is this
What if something similar is happening to ALL of us in our working lives?

 - what if we have all been missing the signals right in front of us?
 - what if the difficulties we feel are real difficulties?  What if the things we see are really there?
 - what if we're all "passing" 
 - what would we like to know if we were "diagnosed?"

---

# A Moment of Clarity

Note:
I'm Aspergers.
I was diagnosed at 40 - up until then I'd thought I was "normal"


"this is how it is"  "this is what we do"

I'd learned to follow to fit in.
I'd 


Suddenly I had a different lense to look at everything through.  Had the conclusions i'd come towhat I thought I'd experienced really happened that way?

I'd been "passing" - a phrase ASD (and Trans people incidentally) use to describe "fitting in" with society's norms. What is more I'd not known it.  Now I asked myself, what had _really_ been happening all those years?

I looked back at history - significant events (SUCH AS?) - and replayed them in my mind.  What had _really_ happened at the time?

I went first to what the cliches and "common knowledge" were about Aspergers - I was in denial. This couldn't be the case, could it?

Then I went to the experts - the cliches must be wrong. But this was largely written by people who weren't Aspergers themselves.  At best, their diagnises were at a degree removed fom the lived experience, and the rationalisations, derived from the base observations jumped to conclusions and resulted in mischacterisations.

EXAMPLES?

### The Worlds Worst Lead Developer / Manager

THIS IS THE BIT WHERE I TAKE THE TWO LENSES, AND PERMISSION TO LOOK THROUGH THEM, FROM THE FIRST PART AND SET UP THE MAIN PART

Going by accepted wisdom, I shouldn't be a people person, and I *definitely* shouldn't be in charge of people; 
I should be happiest coding, hidden away in a darkened room, communicating only by typing.
Listening to the experts, I should be incapable of empathy, overly logical and uncreative. 

Yet I've led highly successful software teams for years. I was good at it and I enjoyed it.
By understanding my Aspergers I've learned that both accepted wisdom and "the experts" are frequently wrong. 
I've also learned that our instincts and an open, investigative mind can frequently lead us in a better direction.

Could the same apply to dev leadership?

I'm NOT going to argue that being Aspergers automatically makes you a better lead.
I AM going to argue that taking a step back and comparing your lived experience against what everyone seems to be telling you is the case is INCREDIBLY informative, and can show you new paths

In this session I’ll talk about the surprising things I’ve learned as I made my own way as a Lead Dev. I'll begin by setting the scene with a little history of management, before challenging three key notions and offering alternatives to replace them:

History / Facts

#### "They barely realise that they practice - or mispractice - management"

Note:
The Essential Drucker, pp3-4. Chapter "management as social function and liberal art" (writing in ????)

[I]n the 1850s the phenomenon of management was unknown. So were the enterprises that managers run. The largest manufacturing company around was a Manchester Cotton mill employing fewer than three hundred people [...]. 

Rarely in human history has an institution emerged as quickly as management or had as great an impact so fast. [Yet f]ew executives are aware of the tremendous impact management has had. 
[...] They barely realise that they practice - or mispractice - management.  
[And] They are [ill prepared for the] problems caused by the very success of management itself.

#### "Command-and-Control structure"

Note:
GO THROUGH THIS SLIDE AND REDUCE IT.
MOVE THINGS WHICH AREN'T HIERARCHY OUT TO OTHER SECTIONS.

Drucker:

"Not many business leaders could have predicted this devleopment back in 1870, when large enterprises were first beginning to take shape.  The reason was not so much lack of foresight as lack of precedent.  At that time, the only large permanent organisation around was the army. (**** And the various religions / preisthoods? ****).  Not surprisingly, therefore, its command-and-control structure became the model for the men who were putting together transcontinental railways, steel mills, modern banks and department stores.  The command model, with a very few at the top giving orders and a great many at the bottom obeying them, remained the norm for nearly one hundred years. But is was never as static as its longevity might suggest. On the contrary, it began to change almost at once, as specialised knowledge of all sorts poured into the enterprise.

... By World War I the standard functions of a manufacturer had been developed: research and engineering, manufacturing, sales, finance and accounting, and a little later human resources (or personnel).

Even more important for its impact on enterprise - and on the world economy in general - was another management-directed development that took place at this time. That was the application of management to manual work in the form of training. the child or wartime necessity, training has propelled the transformation of the world economy in the last forty years because it alloows low-wage countries to do soemthing that traditional economic theory had said could never be done: to become efficient  - and yet still low-wage - competitors almost overnight.

Adam Smith reported that it took several hundred years for a country or region to develop a tradition of labor and advertise in manual and managerial skills needed to produce and market a given product, whether cotton textiles or violins.

During World War I, however, large numbers of unskilled, preindustrial people had to be made productive workers in practically no time. To meet this need, businesses in the United States and the United Kingdom begain to apply the theory of scientific management developed by Frederick W. Taylor between 1885 and 1910 to the systematic training of blue-collar workers on a large scale. Further developed in World War II, training was then picked up by the Japanese and, twenty years later, by the South Koreans who made it the basis for their countries' phenomenal development.

During the 1920s and 1930s, management was applied to many more areas and aspects of the manufacturing business. decentralization, for instance, arose to combine the advantages of bigness and the advantages of smallness within one enterprise.  Accounting went from "bookkeeping" to analysis and control. Planning grew out of the "Gantt charts" designed in 1917 and 1918 to plan war production; and so did the use of analytical logic and statistics, which employ quantification to convert experience and intuition into definitions, information, and diagnosis.  Marketing evolved as a result of applying management concetps to dstribution and selling.  Moreover, as early as the mid-1920s  and early 1930s, some American management ...

#### "The Organisation That Fits the Task"

Note:
Essential Drucker, pp57

"The pioneers of management a century ago were right, _Organisational structure is needed._ The modern enterprise - whether business, civil service, university, hospital, large church or military - needs organisation just as any bioliogical organization beyond the amoeba needs structure. But the pioneers were wrong in their assumption that there is - or should be - one right organization. Just as there are a great number of different structures for biological organizations, so there are a number of organizations for the social organism that is the modern institution."

"Instead of searching for the right organisation, management needs to learn to look for, to develop, to test **the organisation that fits the task**"

#### "The End of Hierarchy(?)"

Note:
[We're now going to point out that Drucker wasn't 100% prescient...]

Essential Drucker, pp. 55

"one hears a great deal today about 'the end of hierarchy.' This is blatant nonsense. In any institution there has to be a final authority, that is 'a boss' - soneone who can make the final decisions and who can expect them to be obeyed. In a situation of common peril - and every institution is likely to encounter it sooner or later - survival of all depends on clear command. If the ship goes down, the captain does not call a meeting, the captain gives an order, must know exactly where to go and what to do, and do it without 'participation' and argument. 'Hierarchy,' and the unquestioning acceptance of it by everyone in the organization, is the only hope in a crisis.

"Other situtaions within the same institution require deliberation. Others still require teamwork - and so on.

"What the business enterprise needs is a principle of management that will give full scope to individual strength and responsibility, and at the same time _give common direction of vision and effort, establish team work, and harmonize the goals of the individual with the commonweal_.

The only principle that can do this is management by objectives _and self-control_.  It makes the commonweal of every manager.  (Is everyone a manager?)  It substitutes for control from the outside the stricter, and more exacting and more effective control from the inside. It motivates the manager to action not because somebody tells him to do something, or talks him into doing it, but because the objective tasks of his task demand it.  He acts not because somebody wants him to but because he himself decides that he has to - he acts, in other words, as a free man."

"To be sure, the fundamental task of management remains the same: to make people capable of joint performance through common goals, common values, the right structure, and the training and development they need to perform and to respond to change. But the very meaning of this task has changed, if only because the performance of management has converted the workforce from one comprised of unskilled labourers to one of highly educated knowledge workers."

TAKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING BACK AT YOUR EXPERIENCE

I hated the thought of being a manager.

I had no idea what a leader even was.

I had been promoted.  I was now "responsible" for 36 souls (soon to grow to 98).

I had power over them.  Vested in me by the hierarchy which I had risen up.

But I felt incredibly uncomfortable about this. Was it possible to be an excellent manager?  Perhaps.  I could direct. I could allocate resources. I could prioritise. I could make decisions. I could reward.

But there was a problem.  This model assumed that I had the most of many things.  It assumed I had the most skill - skill in direction, skill in resource-allocation, skill in prioritisation, skill in decision-making.

It also assumed that the hierarchy was there to make the organisation scale.  I still had a manager.  

TAKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING BACK AT THE 

Were there answers in the books?  Could I read a post on Medium and find out what I should do?  Could I attend a conference?  Could I get some mentoring or training to help me sort this out?

There was a LOT available.  There are whole conferences dedicated to this. There are schools of thought - "servant leadership" et al.

But they all seemed based on the same idea - that the hierarchy was necessary, just how it was implemented and ran was the problem.  You still needed people to be above other people.  And you needed this to be fixed.

WAS THIS REALLY THE ONLY WAY?

Working within this structure was how I'd spent my entire working life.  It was how things were. How they needed to be.  But here I found myself in it, and I had no skills in manipuating it at all.  It was this feeling which sent me searching.



What do we get from hierarchy?
we get power. (hiring, firing, promotion, disciplinary)
we get resources. (budgets)
we get influence. 
we get access. (meetings, information, processes)
we get recognition. 
we get impact. 
we get responsibility. 
we get reimbursement
we get a visible progression
we get ***decisions***


What do we need from hierarchy?
a visible place to look to for support
a place of protection
a broader view
funding
permission

Why are these things there? What are they needed for?

How does hierarchy fail?
The Peter Principle - a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. 

Confusing the chain of command with the chain of communication. Communication need not go through hierarchical channels - Creativity Inc.

(Dig into the chain of command too - why is it needed? For synchronisation and co-ordination.)

# Delegation

Note:
Delegation is the only way to scale and get things done - is there another way?
ACCEPTED WISDOM SAYS:
EXPERTS SAY: 
GET OUT OF THE WAY
ADVICE PROCESS
TURN THE SHIP AROUND ("I intend to")
Near Enemy!: Devolution theatre

When you become senior you get given more to do.  It's because youve been promoted due to being good at your job.  Thats how things work in hierarcical structures.

At some point you will be promoted to the point that you have so much work to do that it becomes impossible (if you're lucky you will realise this before you burn out).  The standard thing to do is delegate.  I was advised to do this.  "Get others to do your work" I was told.

but this was hard, and it sucked too.

## What is _really_ happening here?

It was hard because I had all the information needed to do the thing. Plus I was probably good at it.

It sucked because the way to solve this first problem was to hand off my sucky jobs to people.  But that's a terrible thing.  It's a classic example of "shit rolling downhill".  To make my life better I make the lives of those below me worse.  Plus this reinforces the hierarchy.  I can;t delegate to those parallel to me. Thats organising, not delegating.  I can only give it to those over whom I have power.  By by delegating I'm saying "I ama making you do this."  Even if you are a good boss, and do all the right things about delegating (you took a course or read a book) you're still playing in the same system.

What you need to do is _change the system_.

## What _needs_ to happen instead?
What we want is rapid and correct action.

We want aligned action.

This requires decisions and it requires context.

And it requires _trust_ from everyone else.

The problem is training (and experience) in these skills is frequently gate-kept for those in "managerial" positions. (Training will be(come) different - c.f. Reinvengint Organisations)

## Reverse Delegation

The idea conjoured up by the term "delegation" is one which is predicated on the existence of hierarchy.

The hierarchy is the source of decisions.  It is the source of control. If something is significant, then you need to go up the hierarchy to get that decision.  The hierarchy's job is to keep things stable and aligned. Your managers job is to tell you what to do.

What about enlightened management?  That's what you hear about.  "How to delegate effectively". You hear about the "servant leader".  You can go on great courses and read books about how to lead rather than managing.  Even the great ones.  Generous, empathetic, attentive to others. Push decisions down to the front line.  Can be made without management approval.

But is that necessary?  Because as you go up the hierarchy you lose CONTEXT.  You have control, but you have slower, less contextual decisions.


Make desicions that dramatically affect _your_ live.

## Reinventing Organisations

"Green Organisations n particular dicate much time and money toward training to help new managers al gracefully with power and delegate much of it to their subordinates."

WHAT IS THE FOCUS OF THIS SECTION?


Guiding and controlling decision-making.

CONTROL
