# Aspergers and Dev Leadership
### Some Surprising Lessons

# A Moment of Clarity

Note:
THIS IS THE HIGHLY PERSOAL PIECE WHERE I SELL THE IDEAS THAT "WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW FROM COMMON SENSE" AND "WHAT EXPERTS TELL YOU IS THE CASE" MIGHT BOTH BE WRONG.
I'm Aspergers.
I was diagnosed at 40 - up until then I'd thought I was "normal"
Suddenly I had a different lenses to look at everything through
I went first to what the cliches and "common knowledge" were about Aspergers - I was in denial. This couldn't be the case, could it?
Then I went to the experts - the cliches must be wrong. But this was largely written by people who weren't Aspergers themselves.  At best, their diagnises were at a degree removed fom the lived experience, and the rationalisations, derived from the base observations jumped to conclusions and resulted in mischacterisations.
EXAMPLES?

# I _shouldn't_ be a good Dev Lead

Note:
THIS IS THE BIT WHERE I TAKE THE TWO LENSES, AND PERMISSION TO LOOK THROUGH THEM, FROM THE FIRST PART AND SET UP THE MAIN PART
Going by accepted wisdom, I shouldn't be a people person, and I *definitely* shouldn't be in charge of people; 
I should be happiest coding, hidden away in a darkened room, communicating only by typing.
Listening to the experts, I should be incapable of empathy, overly logical and uncreative. 

Yet I've led highly successful software teams for years. I was good at it and I enjoyed it.
By understanding my Aspergers I've learned that both accepted wisdom and "the experts" are frequently wrong. 
I've also learned that our instincts and an open, investigative mind can frequently lead us in a better direction.

Could the same apply to dev leadership?

I'm NOT going to argue that being Aspergers makes you a better lead.
I AM going to argue that taking a step back and comparing your lived experience against what everyone seems to be telling you is the case is INCREDIBLY informative, and can show you new paths

In this session I’ll talk about the surprising things I’ve learned as I made my own way as a Lead Dev. I'll begin by setting the scene with a little history of management, before challenging three key notions and offering alternatives to replace them:

# A (Secret) History Lesson

Note:
I'm not just making all this stuff up. I did my research too
I'm not just envious of Netflix and Spotify and Steam

# Hierarchy

Note:
Hierarchy is useful, fixed, and an indication of where power *should* lie (people have earned their place) - are there alternatives?
ACCEPTED WISDOM SAYS:
EXPERTS SAY: 

CIRCLES AND ROLES - FLIP HIERARCHY ON IT'S HEAD
NETFLIX 
"Go to the Gemba"
Tribal Leadership
NETFLIX CONTEXT-SETTING
But then how do people progress?
Near Enemy!: Social capital

# Delegation

Note:
Delegation is the only way to scale and get things done - is there another way?
ACCEPTED WISDOM SAYS:
EXPERTS SAY: 
GET OUT OF THE WAY
ADVICE PROCESS
TURN THE SHIP AROUND ("I intend to")
Near Enemy!: Devolution theatre

# Process and Control 

Note:
Self-organisation beyond Sprint-Planning leads to chaos - what if we brought our whole selves to work?
ACCEPTED WISDOM SAYS:
EXPERTS SAY: 
Bureaucracy
NETFLIX CULTURE DECK
NETFLIX CONSTANTLY TRYING TO REMOVE IT
NETFLIX OPENNESS
NETFLIX SCALING
Near Enemy!:

# Conclusions

Note:
I'll conclude by pulling out the unifying themes beneath all this, and asking further questions to get you all questioning your status quo.
