# Aspergers and Dev Leadership
### Some Surprising Lessons

# A Moment of Clarity

Note:
THIS IS THE HIGHLY PERSOAL PIECE WHERE I SELL THE IDEAS THAT "WHAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW FROM COMMON SENSE" AND "WHAT EXPERTS TELL YOU IS THE CASE" MIGHT BOTH BE WRONG.
I'm Aspergers.
I was diagnosed at 40 - up until then I'd thought I was "normal"
Suddenly I had a different lenses to look at everything through
I went first to what the cliches and "common knowledge" were about Aspergers - I was in denial. This couldn't be the case, could it?
Then I went to the experts - the cliches must be wrong. But this was largely written by people who weren't Aspergers themselves.  At best, their diagnises were at a degree removed fom the lived experience, and the rationalisations, derived from the base observations jumped to conclusions and resulted in mischacterisations.

# I _shouldn't_ be a good Dev Lead

Note:
THIS IS THE BIT WHERE I TAKE THE TWO LENSES, AND PERMISSION TO LOOK THROUGH THEM, FROM THE FIRST PART AND SET UP THE MAIN PART
Going by accepted wisdom, I shouldn't be a people person, and I *definitely* shouldn't be in charge of people; 
I should be happiest coding, hidden away in a darkened room, communicating only by typing.
Listening to the experts, I should be incapable of empathy, overly logical and uncreative. 

Yet I've led highly successful software teams for years. I was good at it and I enjoyed it.
By understanding my Aspergers I've learned that both accepted wisdom and "the experts" are frequently wrong. 
I've also learned that our instincts and an open, investigative mind can frequently lead us in a better direction.

Could the same apply to dev leadership?

I'm NOT going to argue that being Aspergers makes you a better lead.
I AM going to argue that taking a step back and comparing your lived experience against what everyone seems to be telling you is the case is INCREDIBLY informative, and can show you new paths

In this session I’ll talk about the surprising things I’ve learned as I made my own way as a Lead Dev. I'll begin by setting the scene with a little history of management, before challenging three key notions and offering alternatives to replace them:

## "They barely realise that they practice - or mispractice - management"

The Essential Drucker, pp3-4. Chapter "management as social function and liberal art" (writing in ?????)

When karl marx was beginning work on Das kapital in the 1850s the phenomenon of management was unknown. So where the enterprises that managers run. The largest manufacturing company around was a manchester Cotton mill employing fewer than three hundred people and owned by Marx's friend and collaborator Freidrich Engels. And in Engel's Mill - one of the most profitable businesses of its day - there were no "managers", only "charge hands" who, themselves workers, enforced discipline over a handful of fellow "proletarians".

Rarely in human history has an institution emerged as quickly as management or had as great an impact so fast. In less than 150 years management has transformed the social and economic fabric of the worlds developed countries . It has created a global economy and set new rules for countries that would participate in that economy as equals. And it has itself been transformed. Few executives are aware of the tremendous impact management has had. Indeed, a good many are like M. Jourdain, the character in Moliere's Bourgeois Gentil-Homme, who did not know that he spoke prose. They barely realise that they practice - or mispractice - management.  As a result, they are ill prepared for the tremendous challenges that now confront them. the truly important challenges that managers face do not come from technology or politics; they do not originate outside of management and enterprise. They are problems caused by the very success of management itself.


## "Make people capable of joint performance"

To be sure, the fundamental task of management remains the same: to make people capable of joint performance through common goals, common values, the right structure, and the training and development they need to perform and to respond to change. But the very meaning of this task has changed, if only because the performance of management has converted the workforce from one comprised of unskilled labourers to one of highly educated knowledge workers.

# Hierarchy

Note:
Hierarchy is useful, fixed, and an indication of where power *should* lie (people have earned their place) - are there alternatives?

TAKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING BACK AT YOUR EXPERIENCE

I hated the thought of being a manager.

I had no idea what a leader even was.

I had been promoted.  I was now "responsible" for 36 souls (soon to grow to 98).

I had power over them.  Vested in me by the hierarchy which I had risen up.

But I felt incredibly uncomfortable about this. Was it possible to be an excellent manager?  Perhaps.  I could direct. I could allocate resources. I could prioritise. I could make decisions. I could reward.

But there was a problem.  This model assumed that I had the most of many things.  It assumed I had the most skill - skill in direction, skill in resource-allocation, skill in prioritisation, skill in decision-making.

It also assumed that the hierarchy was there to make the organisation scale.  I still had a manager.  

TAKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING BACK AT THE 

Were there answers in the books?  Could I read a post on Medium and find out what I should do?  Could I attend a conference?  Could I get some mentoring or training to help me sort this out?

There was a LOT available.  There are whole conferences dedicated to this. There are schools of thought - "servant leadership" et al.

But they all seemed based on the same idea - that the hierarchy was necessary, just how it was implemented and ran was the problem.  You still needed people to be above other people.  And you needed this to be fixed.

WAS THIS REALLY THE ONLY WAY?

Working within this structure was how I'd spent my entire working life.  It was how things were. How they needed to be.  But here I found myself in it, and I had no skills in manipuating it at all.  It was this feeling which sent me searching.



What do we get from hierarchy?
we get power. 
we get resources.
we get influence. 
we get access. 
we get recognition. 
we get impact. 
we get responsibility. 
we get reimbursement
we get a visible progression


What do we need from hierarchy?
a visible place to look to for support
a place of protection
a broader view
funding
permission


How does hierarchy fail?
the peter principle - a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence". In other words, an employee is promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another. 

Confusing the chain of command with the chain of communication. Communication need not go through hierarchical channels - Creativity Inc.

(Dig into the chain of command too - why is it needed? For synchronisation and co-ordination.)

# Conclusions

Note:
I'll conclude by pulling out the unifying themes beneath all this, and asking further questions to get you all questioning your status quo.
